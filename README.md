Question / Thought: 

1.Ideas for error catching/solving, retry strategies? 
Answer: 
When scraping websites, there are several error scenarios that can occur, such as network errors, timeouts, and server errors. To handle these scenarios and prevent your scraping process from failing, you can implement various error catching and retry strategies.
Here are some ideas for error catching and retry strategies:
Retry on network errors
Retry on server errors
Handle timeouts
Handle rate limiting
Handle unexpected responses
Monitor the scraping process


2. Accessing more ads from this link than the limit allows (max 50 pages)?

Anwser :
Use a different search query: If you're searching for ads based on a certain keyword or filter, try using a different query that returns fewer results. For example, you can try searching for a more specific keyword, or using a more restrictive filter.
Use a different website: If the website you're scraping has a limit on the number of pages you can access, you can try using a different website that has similar ads. There are many websites that specialize in classified ads for various types of vehicles, and you may be able to find one that has more ads than the website you're currently scraping.
Scrape the website over a longer period of time: If you can't access all the ads you want in one session, you can scrape the website over a longer period of time, accessing a certain number of pages each day. This will allow you to eventually access all the ads you want, while avoiding any limits on the number of pages you can access in a single session.

3. Experience with CI/CD tools? 
Anwers: CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, which is a software development practice that emphasizes frequent code changes, automated testing, and quick deployment of new features. CI/CD tools are software tools that help automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software applications. Some popular CI/CD tools include Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD, and AWS CodePipeline.

4. Other considerations?

Answer:
Legality: Make sure that you are not violating any laws or terms of service when scraping data from a website. Some websites may prohibit scraping or require permission before doing so.
Ethical considerations: It's important to consider the ethical implications of scraping data from a website. Make sure that you are not harming the website or its users, and that you are not using the data for unethical purposes.
Performance: Web scraping can be resource-intensive, so it's important to optimize your code for performance. Use caching and other techniques to reduce the number of requests and speed up processing.
Robustness: Websites can change their structure or layout at any time, which can break your scraping application. Make sure that your code is robust and can handle unexpected changes in the website's structure.
Data quality: When scraping data, it's important to ensure that the data is of high quality and accuracy. Use techniques such as data validation and error handling to ensure that your data is reliable.
Scalability: If you need to scrape large amounts of data, make sure that your code is scalable and can handle large volumes of data.
Security: When scraping data from a website, make sure that you are not exposing any sensitive information or credentials. Use secure authentication and encryption techniques to protect your data and credentials.
